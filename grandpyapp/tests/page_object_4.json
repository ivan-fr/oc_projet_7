It is especially popular in China, and is called wosun (Chinese: \u83b4\u7b0b; pinyin: w\u014ds\u016dn) or woju (Chinese: \u83b4\u82e3; pinyin:) (although the latter name may also be used to mean lettuce in general).\n\nThe stem is usually harvested at a length of around 15\u201320 cm and a diameter of around 3\u20134 cm. It is crisp, moist, and mildly flavored, and typically prepared by slicing and then stir frying with more strongly flavored ingredients.",
