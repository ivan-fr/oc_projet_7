        "extract": "Tropical Depression Ten was the tenth tropical cyclone of the record-breaking 2005 Atlantic hurricane season. It formed on August 13 from a tropical wave that emerged from the west coast of Africa on August 8. As a result of strong wind shear, the depression remained weak and did not strengthen beyond tropical depression status. The cyclone degenerated on August 14, although its remnants partially contributed to the formation of Tropical Depression Twelve, which eventually intensified into Hurricane Katrina. The cyclone had no effect on land, and did not directly result in any fatalities or damage.",
